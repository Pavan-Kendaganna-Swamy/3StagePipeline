# 3StagePipeline
This project is to demonstrate a simple pipeline consisting of 3 stages
Project Details:
Entire project is built using open source tools called [Qflow](http://opencircuitdesign.com/qflow/)

The qflow package contains all the scripts and most of the tools necessary for the open-source digital synthesis flow. It also comes with some of the files from the OSU (Oklahoma State University) 0.35um standard cell library, to provide a default technology. 

Tech used : 180nm
synthesis : [yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys)
Placement : [graywolf](https://github.com/rubund/graywolf)
sta       : [vesta](http://opencircuitdesign.com/qflow/) // part of qflow package
Routing   : [qrouter](https://opencircuitdesign.com/qrouter/)
Layout 	  : [Magic](http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/)
